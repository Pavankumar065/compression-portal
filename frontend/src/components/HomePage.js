                            Gzip is a widely used data compression program that leverages the **DEFLATE algorithm**. DEFLATE is a combination of a dictionary-based approach for finding repeated sequences and Huffman coding for compactly representing the sequence tokens. It's a highly effective general-purpose lossless data compression algorithm, commonly used for web content, file archiving, and software distribution. It generally provides good compression ratios for a wide variety of data types, including text, images, and binary files, making it the **recommended choice for most files on this portal.**

                        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                            RLE is a very simple form of data compression in which runs of data (sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. It is most effective on data that contains many such runs, e.g., simple graphic images such as icons, line drawings, and faxes. For data with little repetition, RLE can actually increase file size due to the overhead of storing counts for single occurrences.

                        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                            Huffman coding is a variable-length coding algorithm where the most frequent characters are assigned the shortest codes, and the least frequent characters are assigned the longest codes. This statistical compression method is lossless, meaning no data is lost during compression. It's often used as a component within other compression algorithms (like DEFLATE). Its effectiveness depends on the frequency distribution of characters in the data.
